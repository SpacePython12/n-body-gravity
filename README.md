# N-Body Gravity Simulation
Look at the repo description, I'm too lazy to make this interesting for now.

### Wait, why is `gravity.py` there? I thought this was a Rust project.
That's my old gravity simulation that I wrote to get familiar with simulating gravity with arrays. It's still functional, so no reason to get rid of it. It's nowhere near as fast as the Rust version though.
